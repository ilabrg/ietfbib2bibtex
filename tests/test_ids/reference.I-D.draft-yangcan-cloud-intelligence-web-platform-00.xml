      <abstract>
	 <t>   This draft mainly focuses on the scalable architecture and publishing
   protocol standard of REST-based SAAS cloud model Web software in non-
   programming mode, stipulates the data structure pattern and data
   exchange protocol for the construction and release of REST-based
   scalable Web cloud service software systems.  Using the standardized
   framework and protocol, users can easily and quickly design their own
   software systems in the cloud, transfer and release data, which may
   make conventional software development so ease to improve the
   efficiency of complex database construction and server management.
   Without having to write codes under the standard framework, users can
   get consistent style background to create service, rapidly develop
   web application systems with the function of standard data management
   and data maintenance, and directly publish the software system to the
   end users of the Internet for access and use.  And provide RESTful
   APIs to facilitate external access to required service resources.
   The framework can thus greatly shorten the software development life
   cycle, and save a great deal of development cost and maintenance
   overhead.
